# About

My name is Lode Nachtergaele.
I'm an engineer by training, and currently hold the position as data scientist
at
[Colruyt Group](https://www.colruytgroup.com/wps/portal/cg/en/home) (a retailer in Belgium), where I spend time on
writing notebooks in Python.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].



[^1]:a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.
